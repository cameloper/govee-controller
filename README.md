# Govee-Controller

A python gatt wrapper to control Govee LED Strips. This repo is basically modified (improved for my (and generic) use cases) version of [ddxtanx's repo](https://github.com/ddxtanx/GoveeAPI). I would have to reinvent the wheel if it wasn't for them. Thank you ddxtanx!

*further documentation will be added*
